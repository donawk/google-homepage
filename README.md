# Google Homepage Copy

Setting up a copy of Google's homepage as part of an exercise to display what I've learned from The Odin Project (and the first course of FreeCodeCamp) using CSS, HTML and Javascript.

Areas of improvement: Searchbar, to have it be construction be a bit similar to Google's

FOr graders: This project now includes the implementation for the difficult portion of the exercise
